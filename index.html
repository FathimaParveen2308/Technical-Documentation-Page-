        <br><br>What is Gravitation?
    </header>
    <p>
        We are amazed looking at the glittering sky; we wonder how the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West, why there comets or why stars twinkle.  The Sky has been an object of curiosity for human beings from time immemorial.
        We have always wandered about the motion of stars, the Moon and the planets.  From Aristotle to Stephen Hawking, great minds have tried to understand the movement of celestial objects in space and what causes their motion.
        The "Theory of Gravitation" was developed by Newton in the late 17th centuary to explain the motion of celestial objects and terrestial objects and answer most of the queries raised.  In spite of the study of gravitation and its effect
        on celestial objects, spanning last three centuaries, "Gravitation" is still one of the activre areas of research in physics today.  In 2017, the Nobel Prize in physics was given for the detection of 'Gravitational waves' which was theoritically predicted by Albert Einstein in the year 1915.
        Understanding planetary motion, the formation of stars and galaxies, and recently massive objects like black holes and their life cycle have remainded the focus of study for the past few centuaries in physics.

    <section class="main-section" id="Kepler's Laws">
        <header>Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion</header>
        <p>Kepler's laws are stated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Law of Orbits</li>
            <li>Law of Area</li>
            <li>Law of Period</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>1. Law of Orbits:</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Each Planet moves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one of the foci.</li><br>
    <li>The closet point of approach of the planet to the sun 'P' is called perihelion and the farthest point 'A' is called aphelion. The semi-major axis is 'a' and semi-minor axis is 'b'. In fact, both Copernicus and Ptolemy considered planetary orbits to be circular, but Kepler discovered that the actual orbits of the planets are elliptical.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<center>

</center>
    <p><b>2. Law of Area:</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>The radial vector(line joining the Sun to a planet) sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time.</li><br>
    <li>The white Shaded portion is the area &#9651A swept in a small interval of time &#9651t, by a planet around the Sun.  Since the Sun is not at the center of the ellipse,<i>the planets travel faster when they are nearer to the sun and slower when they are farther from it, to cover equal area in equal intervals of time.</i></li>
    <li>Kepler discovered the law of area by carefully noting the variation in the speed of planets.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<center>
    <img src="./law of area.jpeg">
</center>
    <p><b>3. Law of Period:</b><br>
        <ul>
    <li>The Square of the time period of revolution of a planet around the Sun in its elliptical orbit is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse.  It can be written as:</li>
    </ul>
    <equation>
        T&#178; &#8733 a&#179;<br><br>
        T&#178;/a&#179=constant<br>
    </equation>
    <br>Where, T is the time period of revolution for a planet and <i>a</i> is the semi-major axis.  Physically this law implies that as the distance of the planet from the Sun increases, the time period also increases but not at the same rate.<br>

    <section class="main-section" id="Universal Law">
        <header>Universal Law of Gravitation</header>
        <p>Even though Kepler's Laws were able to explain the planetary motion, they failed to explain forces responsible for it.  It was Issac Newton who analyzed Kepler's laws, Galileo's observations and deduced the law of gravitation.
           Newton's law of gravitation states that a particle of mass M<sub>1</sub> attracts any other particle of mass M<sub>2</sub> in the universe with an attractive force.  The strength of this force attraction was found to be directly proportional to the product
           of their masses and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  In mathematical form, it can be written as:<br>
           <equation>
            F= GM<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>/r&#178<br>
            </equation>
           <br> Where G is the Gravitational constant that has the value of 6.67 x 10<sup>-11</sup> Nm&#178kg<sup>-2</sup> and r is the distance between two masses M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>.

    <section class="main-section" id="Gravitational Constant">
        <header>Gravitational Constant</header>
        <p>In the law of gravitation, the value of gravitational constant G plays a very important role.  The value of G explains why the gravitational force between the Earth and the Sun is so great while the same force between two small objects (for example between two human beings)is negligible.
           The force experienced by a mass 'm' which is on the surface of the Earth.
        <equation>
            F=-GM<sub>E</sub>m/R<sub>E</sub>&#178
        </equation>
        M<sub>E</sub>- mass of the Earth, m- mass of the object, R<sub>E</sub>- radius of the Earth.<br>
        <br>Equating Newton's second law, F=-mg, we get:
        <equation>
            -mg=-GM<sub>E</sub>m/R<sub>E</sub>&#178<br><br>
            g=GM<sub>E</sub>/R<sub>E</sub>&#178
        </equation>
        <br>Now the force experienced by some other object of mass M at a distance r from the center of the Earth is given by,
        <equation>
            F=-GM<sub>E</sub>M/r&#178
        </equation>
        <br>Using the value g, the force F will be,
        <equation>
            F=-gMR<sub>E</sub>&#178/r&#178
        </equation>
        <br>From this it is clear that the force can be calculated simply by knowing the value g.  It is to be noted that in the above calculation G is not required.

        <header>Gravitational Potential Energy near the  surface of the Earth</header>
        <p>When an object of mass m is raised to a height h, the potential energy stored in the object is mgh.  This can be derived using the general expression for Gravitational Potential Energy.<br>
           <center>
            <img src="./gravitational potential.jpeg">
            </center>
           Consider the Earth and mass system, with r, the distance between the mass m and the Earth's centre.  Then the Gravitational potential energy,
           <equation>
            U=-GM<sub>e</sub>m/r
           </equation><br>
           Here r=R<sub>e</sub>+h, where R<sub>e</sub>is the radius of the Earth.  h is the height above the Earth's surface.
           <equation>
            U=-GM<sub>e</sub>m/(R<sub>e</sub>+h)
           </equation><br>
           If h << R<sub>e</sub> can be modified as
           <equation>
            U=-G M<sub>e</sub>m/R<sub>e</sub>(1+h/R<sub>e</sub>)<br><br>
            U=-G[M<sub>e</sub>m/R<sub>e</sub>] (1+h/R<sub>e</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>
           </equation><br>
           By using Binomial Expansion and neglecting the higher order terms, we get
           <equation>
            U=-G[M<sub>e</sub>m/R<sub>e</sub>] (1-h/R<sub>e</sub>).
           </equation><br>
           We know that, for a mass m on the Earth's surface,
           <equation>
            G[M<sub>e</sub>]m/R<sub>e</sub>=mgR<sub>e</sub><br><br>
            U=-mgR<sub>e</sub>+mgh
           </equation><br>
           It is clear that the first term in the above expression is independent of the height h.  For example, if the object is taken from height h<sub>1</sub> to h<sub>2</sub> then the potential energy at h<sub>1</sub> is:
           <equation>
            U(h<sub>1</sub>)=-mgR<sub>e</sub> + mgh<sub>1</sub>
           </equation><br>
           and the potential energy at h<sub>1</sub> is
           <equation>
            U(h<sub>2</sub>)=-mgR<sub>e</sub> + mgh<sub>2</sub>
           </equation><br>
           The potential energy difference between h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub> is 
           <equation>
           U(h<sub>2</sub>)-U(h<sub>1</sub>)=mg(h<sub>2</sub>-h<sub>1</sub>).
           </equation><br>      
           The term mgR<sub>e</sub> plays no role in the result.  The first term can be omitted or taken to zero.  Thus it can be stated that The Gravitationalpotential energy stored in the particleof mass m at a height h from the surface of the Earth is U=mgh.
           On the surface of the Earth U=0, since h is zero.<br>
           It is to be noted that mgh is the work done on the particle when we take the mass m from the surface of the Earth to a height h.  This work done is stored as a gravitational potential energy in the mass m.  Even though mgh is gravitational potential energy of the system (Earth and mass m), we can take mgh as gravitational potentialenergy of the mass m since Earth is stationary when the mass moves to height h.

        <header>Recent Developments of Astronomy and Gravitation</header>
        <p>Till the 19th centuary astronomy mainly depended upon either observation with the naked eye or telescopic observation.  After the discovery of the electromagnetic spectrum at the end of the 19th centuary,
            our understanding of the universe increased enormously.  Because of this development in the late 19th centuary it was found that Newton's Law of gravitation could not explain certain phenomena and showed some discrepancies.  
            Albert Einstein formulated his 'General theory of relativity' which is one of the most successful theories of 20th centuary in the field of gravitation.<br>
            In the twentieth centuary both astronomy and gravitation merged together and have grown in manifold.  The birth and death of stars were more clearly understood.  Many Indian physicists made very important contributions to the field of astrophysics and gravitation.
            Subramanian Chandrasekar formulated the theory of black holes and explained the life of the stars.  These studies brought him Nobel prize in the year 1983.  Another notable Indian astrophysicist Meghnad Saha discovered the ionization formula which was useful in classifying stars.
            This formula is known as "Saha ionization formula". In the field of gravitation Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri solved an equation now known as "Raychaudhuri equation" which was a very important contribution.  Another notable Indian Astrophysicist Jayant V Narlikar made pioneering contribution in the field of astrophysics
            and has written interesting books on astronomy and astrophysics.  IUCAA [Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics] is one important Indian research institutes where active research in astrophysics and gravitation are conducted.  The institute was founded by Prof. J.V. Narlikar.  Students are encouraged to read more about the 
            recent developments in these fields.
